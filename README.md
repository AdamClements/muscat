#Muscat

Muscat is an MQTT client library for clojure and clojurescript.

MQTT is a publish/subscribe protocol, therefore muscat has two
functions in its public API: publish and subscribe. It comes with a
couple of different strategies for coercing payloads, from plain UTF-8
string to EDN data. This is also extensible if you want to for example
use the excellent nippy serialisation library (recommended for
clojure, unavailable for clojurescript and it would be too opinionated
to include it in muscat by default).

## Usage

First install an MQTT broker. Mosquitto if only using clojure, for clojurescript Hive is recommended though usage is restricted to 25 connections for the free version, however does work with websockets by default, requiring only a minor tweak to the configuration file (enable the websockets options). Mosquitto client can happily connect to Hive server and vice versa. Mosquitto has the handy `mosquitto_pub` and `mosquitto_sub` for listening to and sending messages via plain string on the command line, which is useful for debugging.

### Basic

Publishing will try and re-use connections where it can, however subscriptions will each start a new connection to the server. In future this may change so that everything attempts to reuse the same connection where possible, however that will be transparent to the API.



### Overriding payload coercion

### Retry strategy
